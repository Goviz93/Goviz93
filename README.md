## 👋 About Me

Senior DevOps & Site Reliability Engineer with hands-on experience designing,
automating and operating production-grade systems across cloud and on-prem environments.

My work lives at the intersection of **delivery and reliability**.
I build platforms, automate workflows, and take responsibility for how they behave in production.

I care deeply about availability, scalability, observability, and recovery —
and I automate relentlessly to protect them.

---

## 🔧 What I Do

- Design and operate end-to-end CI/CD pipelines
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Build and operate Kubernetes-based platforms
- Reduce operational toil through automation
- Improve system reliability through better design, signals and feedback loops

I don’t just ship systems — I **own them in production**.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

My engineering decisions are driven by operational experience and real production failures.

**I don’t just automate processes — I create systems that think for themselves.**

I believe infrastructure should heal, scale, and adapt without human friction.  
My scripts aren’t just code — they’re logic infused with foresight.

I build quiet systems: the kind that disappear when they work,  
and scream when something breaks — just once.

Automation is not about speed.  
It’s about consistency, clarity, and control.

If it’s repeatable, I’ll automate it.  
If it’s messy, I’ll make it clean.

**Everything can be automated.**

## 🧩 How I Work

- I design systems with failure and recovery in mind
- I automate with idempotency and clear rollback paths
- I reduce human error by removing manual steps
- I prefer meaningful signals over noisy alerts
- I document incidents, decisions and lessons learned
- I optimize for long-term stability over short-term wins
